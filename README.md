## Landscape

Tidio helps businesses provide great customer experiences with AI, live chat, Flows, email marketing and ticketing. Tidio is one of the top five live chat apps in the world. 

One of the main innovation in Tidio is with their chat App Lyro, they greet customers with a "Welcome back" message and provide unique discount code. 

Tidio features Live chat, Chatbots, AI features and ticketing process for customers. It uses natural language processing and deep learning to improvise their live chat. 

Olark, tawk.to, Kayako, Inbenta, and Uniphore are some of the 35 competitors of Tidio.

The future plan of Tidio is to put the new capital toward marketing and expanding its 140-person workforce. The company aims to hire 100 people in the next year. The wide range of integrations makes it stand out from its competitors in the same field. 

## Results

As there are numerous automated customer service options available, Tidio stands one of the top 5 chatbots available in the market. 

The core metrics used for Chatbots are percentages based on goal completion rate (GCR) while others can be expressed as a total number of instances.  The other chatbot metrics used in this field are Customer Churn Percentage, MRR Churn Percentage, NET MR Churn, Expansion Revenue Percentage, Net Promoter Score(NPS) , Customer Satisfication Score (CSAT), Customer Experience Score. 

Tidio is performing well when compared to their competitors because NPS , GCR and CSAT scores show high level of customer satisfaction. 

## Recommendations

Although Tidio has over 35 third party platform integrations, the chatbot and widget design does not fit all brand aesthetics. If I were to advise the company, I would suggest to have a lower cost model widget, which smaller businesses can easily integrate. Since higher cost model is one of the drawbacks for Tidio, introducing more economical integration will bring in more revenue. 

Another suggestion for the company would be to create more deeper analysis reporting features which will provide deeper insights that larger businesses need.
